## About the Project
This C++ program is an **interactive “Guess The Random Number” game** .  
The game uses **random number generation**, user input, conditional statements, loops, and functions to create a fully functional, menu-driven program.  

## Key Features
- **Random Number Generation:** Generates a secret number between 1 and 100 using `rand()` and `srand(time(0))`.  
- **Difficulty Levels:** Offers three difficulty modes (Easy, Medium, Hard) with a different number of attempts.  
- **Menu-Driven Interface:** Users can select difficulty levels, try again after winning or losing, or exit the game.  
- **Feedback System:** Gives hints if the guessed number is higher or lower than the secret number.  
- **Replayability:** Allows the player to restart the game multiple times without restarting the program.  

## My Experience
This was one of my first C++ projects as a beginner. Writing this game was both **interesting and fun**, and it helped me learn and practice:  
- Using **functions** to modularize code and separate game logic from the main program.  
- Implementing **loops** and **conditional statements** effectively.  
- Making the code **visually appealing** and easy to read.  
- Managing **user input** and providing clear, interactive feedback.  
- Debugging logic errors and structuring a program to be both **user-friendly and functional**.  

Completing this project gave me a **lot of confidence** in applying basic programming concepts, and it was a rewarding experience to see the game working as intended with multiple features and replayability.
