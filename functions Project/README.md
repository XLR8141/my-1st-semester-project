## my experience :
This was the hardest project for me as a 1st semester student with very little programming experience. It took me about 4–5 days to complete. I tried my best to write the code on my own with minimal help from others, and successfully completed the project.  
Writing over 1000 lines of code as a beginner was an amazing experience and one of my greatest achievements.  
Some of the main difficulties I faced included:

Understanding functions which was a completely new concept for me  
Writing functions in the correct format and placing them properly in the code  
Debugging errors and structuring the project logically  
making the code as clean as possible

Through persistence and practice, I gradually overcame these challenges and completed the project successfully. This experience helped me learn a lot about programming problem solving and project organization and boosted my confidence as a beginner coder.
