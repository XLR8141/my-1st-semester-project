## my experience :
This was the hardest project for me as a 1st semester student with very little programming experience. It took me about 4–5 days to complete. I tried my best to write the code on my own with minimal help from others, and successfully completed the project.  
Writing over 1000 lines of code as a beginner was an amazing experience and one of my greatest achievements.  
Some of the main difficulties I faced included:

- Understanding functions which was a completely new concept for me  
- Writing functions in the correct format and placing them properly in the code  
- Debugging errors and structuring the project logically  
- making the code as clean as possible

Through persistence and practice, I gradually overcame these challenges and completed the project successfully. This experience helped me learn a lot about programming problem solving and project organization and boosted my confidence as a beginner coder.
and it was an ahivement for me that i completed such a project on my own

## about the project:


As part of the project I was tasked with writing **five key functions** each designed to demonstrate a specific programming concept such as **loops, conditional statements (if-else), and switch-case**.  

Each of these functions contained **multiple smaller tasks**, allowing for practical application of the concepts:  
- Functions using **loops** to perform calculations, generate sequences, or process repetitive tasks.  
- Functions using **if-else statements** to make decisions based on user input.  
- Functions using **switch statements** to handle multiple possible choices in a clean and organized way.  
- Each function was modular, self-contained, and reusable, contributing to a **structured and maintainable program design**.  

This exercise helped gain understanding of **modular programming, code reusability, and logical problem-solving** while practicing different core C++ concepts.
